              We strive to ensure quality laundry, on-time delivery and reliable
              service for all linen, uniform and guest laundry needs. A
              dedicated in-plant quality assurance team is on hand to provide a
              regular visual inspection to maintain quality standards and seek
              continuous improvements. The team would review and offer precise
              washing formula suitable for each type of linen.

              Our philosophy is to offer neither discount prices nor high
              prices. We will also make contracts with retail stores to have
              their garments cleaned and altered with a special discount within
              an agreement in place.
