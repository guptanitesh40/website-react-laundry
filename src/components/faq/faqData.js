        question: "What Is Dry Cleaning ?",
        answer:
          "Dry cleaning is the use of solvents to remove soil and stains from fabrics. Dry-cleaning solvent is not harmful to any fabric, and dry cleaning is the only safe method for cleaning many types of garment. Natural fibres such as wools and silks will shrink and perhaps lose their colour if washed in water, but will come out perfectly after dry cleaning. Cottons and linens, if not pre-shrunk when manufactured, will also shrink in home laundering. Dry cleaning is particularly effective in removing greasy, oily stains from synthetic fibres which tend to bind in oils when stained.",
